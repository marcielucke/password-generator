# password-generator
## Description

This code created a randomized password generator with several critera prompts. The purpose is to create the most secure version of a password, while following what the user has chosen for the outline of their password. This was our first bootcamp project that dealt with JavaScript. The starter code helped as a guide to create the functions neccessary to complete the task. In doing this, I was able to practice the working with variables, prompts, functions, and manipulating user data.
